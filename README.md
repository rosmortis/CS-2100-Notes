# UVM CS 2100 Intermediate Programming Notes
Hello reader, these are my notes for CS 2100, they are in no particular order which I understand is not ideal. I took / take all of these notes on obsidian. My instructor is Jacki Horton, and our Textbook is *"Revel for Starting Out With Java from Control Structures through Objects, 8e."* 

If you have edits or corrections text me.
